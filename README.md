# Amazon Sales Dashboard

This project involves designing an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze Amazon sales data, sourced from Kaggle. The dashboard provides comprehensive insights into various key metrics to support data-driven decision-making for the Amazon sales team.

## Project Overview

The Amazon Sales Dashboard was developed to visualize and monitor sales performance across different segments. With a user-friendly interface, it offers in-depth views of sales metrics, product categories, regional performance, and more. This dashboard can help stakeholders quickly understand sales trends and take necessary actions to improve performance and customer satisfaction.

## Key Features and Insights

- **Sales Amount**: Displays the total sales amount, allowing users to see overall revenue performance. The data is broken down by different time periods to track growth and seasonality.
- **Top States for Purchases**: Highlights the top states in terms of purchase volume, making it easy to identify high-performing regions and adjust regional marketing strategies accordingly.
- **Date-wise Sales Tracking**: Provides a daily breakdown of sales, helping to analyze fluctuations, identify peak periods, and make data-backed forecasts.
- **Top Five Product Categories**: Shows the five most popular product categories based on sales, offering insights into customer preferences and helping optimize inventory for these categories.
- **Courier Status**: Tracks the delivery status of orders, indicating the efficiency of the logistics team and allowing for quick identification of delays or bottlenecks.
- **B2B vs. B2C Coverage**: Differentiates between Business-to-Business (B2B) and Business-to-Consumer (B2C) transactions, helping the sales team understand the balance of these segments and adjust strategies to target each effectively.

## Implementation Details

1. **Data Sourcing and Cleaning**: The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and cleaned to ensure consistency. Columns were standardized, missing values were handled, and relevant transformations were applied.

2. **Data Modeling**: A star schema model was created, establishing relationships between fact and dimension tables to enhance the speed and efficiency of analysis.

3. **Measure Calculations**: Custom measures were created to calculate the sales amount, top states, top categories, and other metrics. Conditional formatting and data bars were applied to improve readability.

4. **Visualizations**: 
   - Line and bar charts were used to show date-wise sales trends and top states.
   - A clustered column chart was implemented to compare B2B and B2C sales.
   - A pie chart shows the distribution of courier status.
   - KPI cards display high-level metrics like total sales and top product categories.

## Results and Insights

- **Sales Trends**: The dashboard reveals clear patterns in sales behavior over time, helping identify high-demand periods.
- **Regional Performance**: Top-performing states are highlighted, enabling focused marketing efforts in these regions.
- **Category Performance**: Insights into popular categories help optimize inventory and recommend trending products to customers.
- **Logistics Efficiency**: Courier status tracking provides visibility into delivery times, allowing for continuous improvements in customer service.
